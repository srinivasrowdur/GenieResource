# Resource Genie: LangGraph Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to refactor the Resource Genie application to leverage LangGraph's prebuilt agent architecture. The goal is to simplify our codebase, improve maintainability, and enable faster iterations while preserving ALL existing functionality.

## Current Application Architecture

Our current Resource Genie application uses a custom-built agent system with these components:

1. **Master Agent**: Orchestrates flow between components
2. **Query Translator**: Converts natural language to structured queries
3. **Resource Fetcher**: Retrieves employee data from Firebase
4. **Response Generator**: Creates human-friendly responses
5. **Firebase Integration**: Stores resources and query history
6. **Streamlit UI**: Provides chat interface and trends dashboard

## Benefits of LangGraph Migration

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Reduce custom code and leverage LangGraph's battle-tested patterns
2. **Improved Reasoning**: LangGraph's ReAct agent provides better reasoning capabilities
3. **Built-in State Management**: Leverage LangGraph's checkpoint system instead of custom state handling
4. **Easier Extensibility**: Adding new tools and capabilities becomes more straightforward
5. **Community Support**: Align with broader LangChain ecosystem for updates and improvements

## Functionality Preservation Requirements

All existing functionality must be preserved, including:

- Resource querying by location, skill, rank, and availability
- Query history storage in Firebase
- Trends analytics and visualizations
- Session management
- Metadata extraction from queries
- Chat interface and UX
- Sidebar with resource information
- Error handling and graceful degradation

## Migration Approach: Component by Component

### 1. Tool Definition Layer

Convert our current functionality into LangGraph-compatible tools:

```python
@tool
def query_resources(filters: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Query resources based on location, skills, rank, and availability."""
    # Implementation that uses Firebase client
    
@tool
def get_resource_metadata() -> Dict[str, List[str]]:
    """Retrieve available locations, skills, and ranks."""
    # Implementation that fetches metadata from Firebase
    
@tool
def save_query(query: str, response: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any], session_id: str) -> bool:
    """Save query data to Firebase for analytics."""
    # Implementation that saves to the queries collection
```

### 2. Agent Construction

Replace our custom Master Agent with a LangGraph ReAct agent:

```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620", temperature=0)
checkpointer = MemorySaver()

# Define tools
tools = [query_resources, get_resource_metadata, save_query]

# Create the agent
agent = create_react_agent(
    model, 
    tools, 
    checkpointer=checkpointer
)
```

### 3. UI Integration Layer

Maintain the existing Streamlit UI but modify how it interacts with the agent:

```python
# Accept user input
if prompt := st.chat_input("Ask about employees..."):
    # Add user message to chat history
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
    
    # Display user message
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.markdown(prompt)

    # Process with agent
    with st.chat_message("assistant"):
        with st.spinner("Thinking..."):
            # Use LangGraph agent
            final_state = agent.invoke(
                {"messages": st.session_state.messages},
                config={"configurable": {"thread_id": st.session_state.session_id}}
            )
            
            # Extract response
            response = final_state["messages"][-1].content
            
            # Display response
            st.markdown(response)
            
            # Save to chat history
            st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
```

### 4. Analytics Integration

Preserve all analytics functionality by using the save_query tool and maintaining the existing trends dashboard:

```python
# The agent will be configured to call the save_query tool automatically
# We'll ensure the trends dashboard reads from the same Firebase collection
```

## Implementation Plan

- Implement Firebase connection and data storage
- Create trends dashboard with analytics visualizations
- Test the complete user flow

### Phase 3: Testing & Optimization (COMPLETED)
- Implement comprehensive testing framework

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Challenge**: LangGraph agent may handle context differently
   **Mitigation**: Extensive testing with follow-up questions and context preservation

2. **Challenge**: Tool conversion may lose nuanced functionality
   **Mitigation**: Thorough testing of each tool and comparison with current behavior

3. **Challenge**: Session management differences
   **Mitigation**: Careful integration of LangGraph's checkpointer with Streamlit's session state

4. **Challenge**: Performance impacts
   **Mitigation**: Benchmark and optimize, potentially using streaming responses

## Success Criteria

1. All existing queries work with the new architecture
2. Firebase integration for both resources and analytics is maintained
3. Trends dashboard shows correct data
4. UI experience remains consistent
5. Performance is equal or better than current implementation
6. Code is more maintainable and easier to extend

## Post-Migration Improvements

Once the migration is complete, we can leverage LangGraph's features to add:

1. Better follow-up question handling
2. Tool execution tracing for debugging
3. More advanced reasoning patterns
4. Multi-agent collaboration
5. Better error recovery mechanisms
