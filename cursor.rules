# Resource Management System Rules

## Query Processing
1. ALWAYS use LLM (Claude) for query processing
2. NO regression to traditional NLP/regex methods
3. Maintain semantic understanding and context awareness

## Code Organization
1. Keep query processing logic in agents.py
2. Use firebase_utils.py for data access only
3. Maintain clear separation between query processing and data access

## Testing
1. Test LLM query processing with varied inputs
2. Verify context handling across conversations
3. Validate structured query outputs

## Performance
1. Optimize LLM prompts for efficiency
2. Cache common query patterns
3. Monitor and log query processing times
